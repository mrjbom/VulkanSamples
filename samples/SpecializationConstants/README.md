# Specialization constants

Specialization constants is a mechanism for specifying constants in the shader whose values will be specified in the shader module when the pipeline is created. This allows you to change the constant values in the shader while the application is running.

In this example, two graphics pipelines are created that set different values for the colors used by the shader in their shader modules.
